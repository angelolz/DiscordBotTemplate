# Java Discord Bot Template
This is the base code that I use that appears in all the bots that I've created. This includes [Animal Crossing Bot](http://angelolz.dev/acbot) 
and [Wordie](http://angelolz.dev/wordie).

# Depedencies
This project comes with a few dependencies that will aid in the development of the Discord bot.

- JDA *(Discord API wrapper)*
- JDA-Chewtils *(Extensions to JDA that adds support for command cooldowns, slash commands, etc.)*
- logback-classic *(logging)*

## Before Running...

Please make sure that you fill in the `bot_token` and `owner_id` in the `bot.properties` file! Don't forget to add the file
to your `.gitignore`!
